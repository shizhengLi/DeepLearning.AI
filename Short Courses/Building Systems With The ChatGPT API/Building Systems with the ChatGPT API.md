## What you’ll learn in this course

In **Building Systems with the ChatGPT API,** you will learn how to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model. Unlock new development capabilities and improve your efficiency in this brand new short course.

You’ll build:

- Chains of prompts that interact with the completions of prior prompts.
- Systems where Python code interacts with both completions and new prompts.
- A customer service chatbot using all the techniques from this course.

You’ll learn how to apply these skills to practical scenarios, including classifying user queries to a chat agent’s response, evaluating user queries for safety, and processing tasks for chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning. 



# Language Models, the Chat Format and Tokens



## Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.



```py
import os
import openai
import tiktoken
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```







#### helper function
This may look familiar if you took the earlier course "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" Course. 

Throughout this course, we will use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat).

This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs. 

**Note**: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to produce the desired results.







```py
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

**Note**: This and all other lab notebooks of this course use OpenAI library version `0.27.0`. 

In order to use the OpenAI library version `1.0.0`, here is the code that you would use instead for the get_completion function: 

```python
client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```



## Prompt the model and get a completion



```py
response = get_completion("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

Output

```pyp
The capital of France is Paris.
```



## Tokens



```py
response = get_completion("Take the letters in lollipop \
and reverse them")
print(response)
```

Output

```py
'p-o-p-i-l-l-o-l'
```



## Helper function (chat format)
Here's the helper function we'll use in this course.



```py
def get_completion_from_messages(messages, 
                                 model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
                                 temperature=0, 
                                 max_tokens=500):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
        max_tokens=max_tokens, # the maximum number of tokens the model can ouptut 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```





```py
messages =  [  
{'role':'system', 
 'content':"""You are an assistant who\
 responds in the style of Dr Seuss."""},    
{'role':'user', 
 'content':"""write me a very short poem\
 about a happy carrot"""},  
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature=1)
print(response)
```



Output

```py
Oh what a sight, that happy carrot so bright,
In the garden it grows with all its might.
With a leafy green top, and roots down below,
It's the happiest veggie in every row!
```





```py
# length
messages =  [  
{'role':'system',
 'content':'All your responses must be \
one sentence long.'},    
{'role':'user',
 'content':'write me a story about a happy carrot'},  
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, temperature =1)
print(response)
```



Output

```py
Once there was a cheerful carrot named Carl who loved to make friends with all the veggies in the garden.
```



```py
# combined
messages =  [  
{'role':'system',
 'content':"""You are an assistant who \
responds in the style of Dr Seuss. \
All your responses must be one sentence long."""},    
{'role':'user',
 'content':"""write me a story about a happy carrot"""},
] 
response = get_completion_from_messages(messages, 
                                        temperature =1)
print(response)
```

Output

```py
In a garden so bright, a carrot named Clyde grew tall with delight.
```



```py
def get_completion_and_token_count(messages, 
                                   model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
                                   temperature=0, 
                                   max_tokens=500):
    
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, 
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
    )
    
    content = response.choices[0].message["content"]
    
    token_dict = {
'prompt_tokens':response['usage']['prompt_tokens'],
'completion_tokens':response['usage']['completion_tokens'],
'total_tokens':response['usage']['total_tokens'],
    }

    return content, token_dict
```







```py
messages = [
{'role':'system', 
 'content':"""You are an assistant who responds\
 in the style of Dr Seuss."""},    
{'role':'user',
 'content':"""write me a very short poem \ 
 about a happy carrot"""},  
] 
response, token_dict = get_completion_and_token_count(messages)
```





```py
print(response)
```

Output

```py
Oh, the happy carrot, so bright and so bold,
In the garden, its story is joyfully told.
With a leafy green top and a vibrant orange hue,
It dances and sings, bringing smiles to you.
```



```py
print(token_dict)
```

Output

```json
{'prompt_tokens': 37, 'completion_tokens': 45, 'total_tokens': 82}
```



Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom

To install the OpenAI Python library:
```
!pip install openai
```

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 

You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:
 ```
 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
 ```

Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."
```

 A note about the backslash

- In the course, we are using a backslash `\` to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
- GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not.  But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.

Step 3:{delimiter} If the message contains products \
in the list above, list any assumptions that the \
user is making in their \
message e.g. that Laptop X is bigger than \
Laptop Y, or that Laptop Z has a 2 year warranty.

Step 4:{delimiter}: If the user made any assumptions, \
figure out whether the assumption is true based on your \
product information. 

Step 5:{delimiter}: First, politely correct the \
customer's incorrect assumptions if applicable. \
Only mention or reference products in the list of \
5 available products, as these are the only 5 \
products that the store sells. \
Answer the customer in a friendly tone.

Use the following format:
Step 1:{delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
Step 2:{delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
Step 3:{delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
Step 4:{delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>
Response to user:{delimiter} <response to customer>

Make sure to include {delimiter} to separate every step.

Response to user:#### We currently do not sell TVs. Our store specializes in computers and laptops. If you have any questions about our available products, feel free to ask!
```

## Inner Monologue
- Since we asked the LLM to separate its reasoning steps by a delimiter, we can hide the chain-of-thought reasoning from the final output that the user sees.



```py
try:
    final_response = response.split(delimiter)[-1].strip()
except Exception as e:
    final_response = "Sorry, I'm having trouble right now, please try asking another question."
    
print(final_response)
```



Output

```
We currently do not sell TVs. Our store specializes in computers and laptops. If you have any questions about our available products, feel free to ask!
```

这段代码(`response.split(delimiter)[-1].strip()`)解释：

这段代码的作用是从 `response` 中提取最后一部分的响应文本。首先，它使用 `split(delimiter)` 函数将 `response` 字符串按照指定的分隔符 `####` 进行分割，得到一个字符串列表。然后，使用索引 `[-1]` 选择列表中的最后一个元素，即分割后的最后一部分。最后，使用 `strip()` 函数去除这部分字符串两侧可能存在的空白字符（如空格、换行符等）。

因此，`final_response` 变量将包含 `response` 中最后一部分的响应文本，而不包括分隔符 `####`。
